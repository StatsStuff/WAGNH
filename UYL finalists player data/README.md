# UYL finalist player data

Just some basic analysis to check how many, and to what degree, UYL finalists progress to senior international competions...

All data was scraped from transfermarkt.com (Â© Transfermarkt GmbH & Co. KG 2000-2021).

This undertaking was completed for purely educational, news reporting, teaching and research purposes as covered by Fair Use.

As this was just a quick analysis, my apologies for the dirtyness of the code...
